## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- SASS
- Flexbox
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

The tricki about this one was the green layer over the picture, and the little eye icon over it.
All the proyect was made in 30~45 min. but I struggle for about 2 hours whith the hover property and the green layer requierement.

This was my first solo flight with SASS and it was fun! I love how SASS structures the code, the process just fits perfectly with my mind. When I review the CSS file, I recognize that it would be a headache to work
